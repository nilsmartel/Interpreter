# interpreter

this is a simple scripting language designed to teach myself a little bit about interpreters and because it's fun.

Ultimately I am interested about creating a feature set, that would make this language a nice fit to replace bash.
Though that is a non priority, as this is a fun project to work on, more than anything else
